# ev-charging-gap-finder
Reproducible pipeline (SQL+dbt) analyzing U.S. EV charging with DOE AFDC + NREL data. Cleans/models stations, joins Census population &amp; highway corridors, and computes DC fast coverage per 100k + corridor gap distances. Outputs an interactive dashboard and 1-page memo to prioritize where new fast chargers add the most value.
